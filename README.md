## Linux Subsystem

The aim of this project is to create a cross platform qemu wrapper that will allow the creation of a "Linux Sybsystem" on the host machine using appropriate hardware acceleration for each platform.

Documentation regarding usage and requirements will be added in future commits as the project develops.
